### ChatGPT
- Mostly asked it for specifics that my code needs and asked it to explain to me how it works, how to put it in and if it is valid or not.
### MDN Web Docs
- Used it to search for methods and their parameters in order for my code to work.

# Code Journal

## Entry 1
 Enjoyed making functions, it was an easier task than I thought but got stuck with some logic. Decided to use ChatGPT with some simple logic and found it easier to just make more functions than scattering random code.

## Entry 2
 Regex hurts my brain. After multiple attempts and a few failures, I managed to get what I want as a password validator which are:
- At least one digit (`\d`)
- At least one lower case letter (`[a-z]`)
- At least one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`)
- A minimum of 8 Characters (`.{8,}`)

## Entry 3
The new function broke the code so I scrapped it. Making up a new one

## Entry 4
Decided on a simple string concat game where your input is placed above the text and is changed when you placed an input. 

## Entry 5
Learned a cool thing when researching, "event.preventDefault" prevents the page to reload whenever a submit request is sent. Also learned about the .value method which gives me a couple new ideas now. 


## Entry 6
Learned more stuff about numerical methods. parseFloat turns an input into numerical value in which I can use for my math
