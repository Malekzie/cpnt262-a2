# Strings and Numbers

- Mostly asked it for specifics that my code needs and asked it to explain to me how it works, how to put it in and if it is valid or not.
### For example:
- In my clickCounter function, I asked it to help me prevent users from making the counter go below 0 as I attempted to make the same thing but got stuck with -1 as the value and get an alert after I attempted to decrease the value further which is not what I wanted. It suggested me an if statement that checks the counter value if it is above 0 and executes the code and anything else would give an alert

- Used this for my isValidPassword function to check for specifics such as password begins with a string and used the FreeCodeCamp as a refresher to RegEx's

# Code Journal

## Entry 1
 Enjoyed making functions, it was an easier task than I thought but got stuck with some logic. Decided to use ChatGPT with some simple logic and found it easier to just make more functions than scattering random code.

## Entry 2
 Regex hurts my brain. After multiple attempts and a few failures, I managed to get what I want as a password validator which are:
- At least one digit (`\d`)
- At least one lower case letter (`[a-z]`)
- At least one uppercase letter (`[A-Z]`)
- A minimum of 8 Characters (`.{8,}`)

## Entry 3
The new function broke the code so I scrapped it. Making up a new one

## Entry 4
Decided on a simple string concat game where your input is placed above the text and is changed when you placed an input. 

## Entry 5
Learned a cool thing when researching, "event.preventDefault" prevents the page to reload whenever a submit request is sent. Also learned about the .value method which gives me a couple new ideas now. 


## Entry 6
Learned more stuff about numerical methods. parseFloat turns an input into numerical value in which I can use for my math
